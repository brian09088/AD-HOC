## Summary
When a device connects to a network, the channel access method that enables the sharing of both transmitted and received data on the same physical medium is called duplexing. Current full-duplex research mainly focuses on physical layer design that can achieve bidirectional transmission between a pair of nodes.
The authors established an analysis framework to quantify the network capacity gain of full-duplex compared to half-duplex. However, line interference and spatial reuse significantly reduce the benefits of full-duplex. By comparing the optimal half-duplex and full-duplex MAC algorithms, it was found that when applied to wireless networks based on Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA), the benefits of full-duplex are slightly reduced.
This article quantifies the benefits of full-duplex wireless networks. The analysis results show that even if perfect self-interference cancellation is assumed, full-duplex radio cannot double network capacity. The key lies in the network layer mechanisms, such as spatial reuse and asynchronous contention effects, that affect wireless networks.

## Strength
Time-Division Duplexing (TDD) has significant advantages in asymmetric networks (networks with unbalanced upload and download bandwidths). It can dynamically adjust the corresponding bandwidth according to the amount of uploaded and downloaded data. Another advantage is that in slow-moving systems, the wireless circuits for uploading and downloading are roughly the same, so techniques like beamforming can be applied in TDD systems.
Telephones and mobile phones are full-duplex systems that enable simultaneous transmission and reception of audio, accelerating the transmission of messages.

## Weaknesses
When the amount of uploaded and downloaded data is similar, Time-Division Duplexing (TDD) wastes some time when switching between transmission and reception, and the delay time is longer, the line is more complex, and it consumes more power. In this case, Frequency-Division Duplexing (FDD) is more efficient.
Full-duplex allows the receiver to send data packets at the same time, but this additional transmitter expands the interference area, which even half-duplex radios will reuse.

## Comments
Different methods should be adopted for different systems: Time-Division Duplexing (TDD) should be used in asymmetric networks (networks with unbalanced upload and download bandwidths), and Frequency-Division Duplexing (FDD) should be used when the amount of uploaded and downloaded data is similar. The optimal full-duplex MAC utility in this article has a similar concept to the existing optimal CSMA utility. However, the goal is not to implement a new MAC protocol, but to make a fair comparison of the optimal throughput between half-duplex and full-duplex networks, and to extract the key factors that future MAC protocols should consider in exploring the benefits of full-duplex.
